# 💬 Sentiment Analysis Classifier

✌ **Hello!**  
This project is a **text classification model** developed for **sentiment analysis**. It uses a custom deep learning architecture (inspired by AlexNet-style CNNs for text) and is trained on a labeled dataset of sentiment-tagged texts (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).

---

## 🧠 Overview

The model reads in a dataset of texts and classifies them into sentiment categories.  
It is designed for educational and experimental purposes, and all **required comments** are added throughout the code to help you understand and modify it.

---

## ✅ Key Features

- Fully commented Python code (easy to follow)
- Preprocessing for text input (tokenization, padding, etc.)
- Model architecture clearly shown and documented
- Dataset structure example included
- ⚠️ **Warning for custom datasets** (like spam detection):
  - Make sure the number of output labels **matches** the model output layer
  - Ensure your dataset structure fits the code logic

## 📁 Dataset Format

The dataset used is assumed to be in CSV format with columns like:
text,label
"I love this product!",positive
"This was terrible.",negative
